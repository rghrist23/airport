index.php is landing page 
using a bootstrap panel to control the view for mobile phones(no implementation for desktop)

still need to convert DB into mysql DB to connect to it

If you want to test the php pages out then you will need to install xampp or wampp
  1. Set up php apache and mysql server
  2. Put files in correct folder
    2a. For xampp, that would be xampp/htdocs/myfolder/myfiles
  3. Navigate to 127.0.0.1 to see the dashboard
  4. If working, go to 127.0.0.1/myfolder and the index.php file should be loaded
  
  
To use git -->
  https://git-for-windows.github.io/ for windows installation (mac you are on your own, but should be something like sudo apt-get install git-core);
  install the gitbash client for easy use;
  open gitbash in a directory you want the files;
  
  
  
    1. mkdir -p folderNew
    2. cd folderNew
    3. git init
    4. git clone https://github.com/rghrist23/airport.git
    5. git status (you want to be in master)
    6. git checkout -b BRANCHNAME
    7. do some work
